Welcome to Chore Tracker! The app allows admins to assign chores to their kids.
Those chores can be completed to earn points to be used towards prizes.

The user is first directed to the login screen.

After making an account, or signing in, the user will be brought to their personal home screen.
This is an example family consisting of a mom and 3 kids.

The admin accounts have significantly more functionality than user accounts. 
From the home page, the admin can:
  1. Check chores
  2. Reassign/edit/delete chores
  3. Award prizes

From the user home page, one can:
  1. Mark their chores as complete
  2. See when their admin checks their chores.
